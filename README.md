# music-survey
I made a survey and I need to figure out how github works.

About a month ago, it was asked that I demonstrate my abilities in python. I will be completely honest when I say I was not enthusiastic about this prospect, because my skill level is a lot lower than it honestly should be. This did not mean I would not try, though. I wrote up a survey in Google Forms that asked people to rate a selection of artists on a scale 1-10, 1 being lowest and 10 being highest. The point of this was just to ascertain general opinion of the artists. I also grouped by genre, so people could only rate artists from genres they felt comfortable rating and the data would be less diluted by neutral opinions. 
I posted the survey on my Instagram and Twitter, in addition to sending it to a few people I felt would appreciate it. I got 34 responses, which was honestly more than I expected. I also got a few compliments for my survey-making, which was nice. 
After around a month of completely ignoring the project in favor of AP exams and finals, I returned to the project. I have split the csv file into 7 dataframes, one for each genre, and I made a few histograms. Making 70 categories for data was a really stupid move, and I wasn't able to visually represent most of them, so I've included a table with some helpful statistics.
